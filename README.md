### RADAR Interference Removal


Radar plays an important role in weather forecasting and monitoring because it allows us to observe and analyze cloud structures and movements in real-time. However, Radar also detects some unwanted signal or noise known as Radar interference. Interference can occur due to a range of factors, including atmospheric conditions, reflections, electromagnetic interference, and jamming. Interference can degrade the quality and accuracy of radar signals, making it important to develop effective techniques for removing unwanted signals and reducing the impact of interference on radar systems.

Our objective was to identify these Radar interferences and remove from the images. Moreover, we needed to re-construct the cloud structure after removing Radar interference in the cloud. Finally, we needed to save the correct data into a file in netCDF format.
